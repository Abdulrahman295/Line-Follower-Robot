# Line-Follower-Robot
### Introduction:
In this project we will design a robot car which can detect a black line and follow it through a curved path.

### Technologies:
We used Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that uses the c\c++ programming language.

### Project Components:
- Arduino Uno
- IR Sensor
- L289 Motor Driver
- Robot Car Chassis 1 Layer
- Two 9V-Dc Motors 
- Three Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries (3.7V)
